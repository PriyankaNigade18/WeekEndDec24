==================
Variables
============
1.Local variable
------------------
Any variable declare inside a method called Local variable

Scope: Within Method
Memory Allocate: At the time of method execution
Memory deallocation: After method execution

2.Instance Variable
---------------------------
Any variable declare inside class and outside any method/block/constuctor
without static keyword is called instance variable

Scope: Within Object
Memory Allocate: At the time of creation of object
Memory deallocation: After object execution /object destroyed

for every new object new memory will be created.


3.Static Variables
------------------------
Any variable declare inside class and outside any method/block/constuctor
with static keyword is called static variable

anything which is common for all the objects that you can declare as static

Scope: Within class
Memory Allocate: At the time of class loading
Memory deallocation: After class unload 

for every new object same memory will be shared.
to call static data we don't need any object

static keyword
=====================
Static keyword help for memory management
1.static variable
2.static block
---------------
static block is used to initialize static variable
static block get the first priority

3.static method
--------------------



======================================
	this Keyword, super keyword & final keyword
	we can use in inheritance

this keyword is used to refer current class variable,method and constructor.

Super Keyword
============================
1.Super keyword can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
2.Super keyword can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
3.Super keyword can be used to call immediate parent class constructor.(super())

final Keyword
======================================
final keyword can be apply for variable,method and class
1.If we apply final keyword to variable then that variable will be consider constant variable
(value will become fix...no one can update)
2.If we apply final keyword to method then we cant override that method in other class or child class
3.If we apply final keyword to class then we can not extend that class into another class.
===============================================================
IQ: How we can implement immutable class ,variable or method in java?
Ans: Using final keyword.
==============================================================







Data Abstraction
================
It is process of hiding implementation details of software from end user.

Abstraction achive using
------------------------------
1.Abstarct class
2.Interface

1.Abstarct class
===============
1.In abstract class we can have both abstract method and non abstarct (concreate) Methods.
2.Abstract method and class we can declare using abstract keyword.
3.Abstract class can not be instantiated.
4.Abstract methods must be overriden by class which inherits abstract class.
5.Using Abstract class partial abstraction is possible.

Interface
===========
1.An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. 
2.Interface contains final and static variables.
3.Interface contains abstract methods.
4.An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
5.Methods in interface are public by default.
6.Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
7.We can define interface with interface keyword.
8.A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface
 but a class implements an interface.
9.We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
10.Inheritance use extends keyword and Interface use implements keyword.
